The final project for my ICS314 class (software development) was to create a dynamic web application based on a service we felt was needed on our won college campus.  In our case, we built a platform for students to buy and sell used textbooks between their peers.  We were given about 6 weeks to complete our task split into 3 milestone checkpoints.  The first milestone was to get our base application up and running.  This meant to create project on GitHub, create the mockup pages, and solidify our plans for the app.  The second milestone was to develop the back end of our website.  This included creating the database collections to store textbooks and profile information, creating links between pages using the meteor router, and developing the baseline functions such as displaying textbooks for sale.  The last milestone was used to finalize our website by further develop its functions.  In this milestone we added more information for textbooks and users, created a filter/search function on our display page, and fixed lots of bugs.  Users on the final version of the app are able to create/sign in to a profile, put books up for sale, show interest in books they want to buy, see their profile information and all books they are selling, edit their profile information, and edit their book information, search for books on sale, and filter the books on sale by major.

For this project, I was responsible for creating most of the issues to complete for each milestone and the front/backend development of multiple webpages.  For the frontend, I was responsible for laying out the landing page, profile page, individual textbook page, and the profile edit page.  For the backend development, I was responsible for creating the database collection to hold additional information about the user, correctly routing users to the correct profile page, correctly routing textbook listings to their individual listing page, displaying the users information and books they are selling on the profile page, allowing users to edit their account information, creating the buyers comments, and random bug fixes.  I also played a big role in our team’s communication.  I tried to make sure that everyone knew what was going on and that we were all on the same page.  This was sometimes hard due to our team’s slight language barrier, but I think we all did a good job working around it.

I learned many things throughout this project, but I think the two most important things were how to develop “real” web applications and how to manage a group in a real work environment.  For these two lessons I say the word “real” because, up until now, I think I had a relatively narrow view of web development and group management.  Every web development lesson until this point was preplanned and I was given each step.  Creating my own application from a blank template was a different experience because it allowed me to have a deeper understanding of how the application worked instead of watching a video lecture and seeing if I did the correct steps.  This is also true for group management.  Until now all of my group work in school was simple because all group members would all work on the same thing together.  This, however, was different because all members of our group were working on different issues in parallel.  This caused us to be extremely unorganized for the first week but as time went on, we began to understand this new parallel workflow and we slowly learned how to best manage our group.
