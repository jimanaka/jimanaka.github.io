summary: Final project for ICS111 by me and my partner Manalu Nakanishi.  A primitive Bomberman style game developed using the EZ library.
---


The final project for ICS111 was a free form coding challenge where students were allowed to choose any game to make.  My partner and I were given about a week to create this game and present it to the class.  The project required the use of a Java graphics library called EZ.  This allowed us to use some powerful graphical functions without much in-depth graphical coding knowledge.  We chose to remake the game "Bomberman" because of the interesting mechanics in the gameplay.  We were not taught many of the techniques required to re-create Bomberman so this was a test of how much we could learn on our own.

For this project, I was responsible for researching what techniques were needed to solve our problems, the actual implementation of those techniques, the overall game direction, and I had a small part in the visual/sound design.  One problem that occured when programming the back end was how to set more than one bomb down at once both with their own explosion timers.  To solve this I researched online for a while and eventually came across the idea of threading.  I had no idea what the proper way to implement multiple threads was, but after some trial and error I got it to work.  Some other implementations that I was in charge of was how to relate player position to solid objects/explosions, the algorithm to decide how much of the explosion should be seen, and how the explosion appears on screen.  Though we didn't have the most well made game in the class, I am still proud of what my partner and I created with our limited knowledge.

From this expirience I learned a lot of new skills such as creating assets (pixel art), how to lead the design and direction of a project, and how to utilize resources to learn new skills to solve unexpected problems.  Even though the assets and animations were not perfect or if my implementation of threads was atrocious, I believe I still learned a great deal by simply struggling to put together a working game.
