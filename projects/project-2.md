The 4x400m is a relay race conisting of 4 legs.  Each leg runs 1 lap around the track (400m) to complete the race.  In 2017, I was on a relay team and our goal was to break the Kaiser High School 4x400m relay record.  The time to beat was 3:30.31 set just the year before in 2016.  We gradually improved our time throughout the track season.  We tried different running strategies such as, running orders, baton hand-off techniques, and many others.  All the effort was worth it when we ran a 3:25.89 at the Punahou Relays meet, breaking the record by a whole 5 seconds.

On my team, I was the starter, the first leg in the race.  I was tasked with getting setting a good pace and grasping a good position from the start.  In a relay, each leg has its own job depending on what your strategy is.  Usually though, the fourth leg (anchor) is the fastest, the first leg is the second fastest, and the second/third legs are about equal.  The idea behind this is to start and end strong while keeping a stable position throughout the middle of the race.  I was one of the slower members of my team so throughout the season my leg constantly changed between second and third.  As the end of the season approached, I decided to make a change and go first.  The reason for this was, even though I was a slower member of the team, I was the fastest out of the starting blocks.  We changed our strategy to accommodate this by putting our slower members first and our faster members last.  It was a risky decision to put myself first because, in contrast, all other teams were putting some of their fastest runners first.  This would make it hard for me to keep up and get a good starting position.  In the end, this decision helped us reduce our time by over 5 seconds and break the record.

From this experience I learned the importance of leadership and innovation.  As I was one of the two upperclassmen on the team, I had to make a decision that could have hurt our time by trying something very different than what other teams were doing.  After all of our expirimenting it turned out that this odd strategy was what it took to push us past that last hurdle.
