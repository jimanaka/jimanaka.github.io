summary: Performed a piano accompaniment for an ban playing the song "Carmina Burana".

The OBDA Select Band is an organization that students audition in to to perform music at a high level.  In 2017, my friend and I were asked to play the piano accompaniment for the High School Select Band for the song "Carmina Burana".  Carmina Burana is an almost 30 minute song with 25 movements.

The accompaniment was split into two parts.  My role was to perform the bass part (part 2).  During the performance I was in charge of keeping my partner in rythm and driving the dynamic of the song.
