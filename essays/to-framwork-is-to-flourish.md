## Close Encounters of the Third Kind
HTML and CSS... oh my.  Until now I've never touched it, barely seen it, and didn't get it.  I've always been curious about how people make webpages.  Was it easy?  There are so many webpages made by so many people, it must be doable.  Was it difficult?  If it's so easy, why is it that the moment I press f12 in a browser my head starts to spin?  No matter the case, there was only one course of action for the past two weeks, to learn.  I'm just going to be blunt, when I first started, I was god awful.  I researched online and watched some online courses but when it came time for me to create a page on my own, I couldn't even remember the first steps.  When it came time to do assignments for class, I had to watch the instructional videos to do anything.  The problem was that it was too alien.  Usually I write code about data and numbers, now, all I could think about was divs and containers.  I was using raw and unadulterated HTML.  Every div or every pixel of padding had to be hand coded.  I was creating such abominations, I started to wonder if I could ever make an aesthetic page.
    
## Semantic UI Descends!
In computer science, if you have a problem, there is a good chance someone already solved it.  This is exactly the case with web frameworks.  Semantic UI in particular, tries to lessen the amount of raw code you have to write by trying to translate natural language into pre-made HTML classes.  Once I learned about this, a whole universe of front-end web development opened up to me.  So far, my most notable accomplishment is re-creating part of the University of Hawaii Hamilton Library webpage.
Here is the original page on the left and my remake on the right:
<div class="ui medium images">
    <img class="ui left image" src="/images/website-original.jpg">
    <img class="ui right image" src="/images/website-remake.jpg">
</div>
I gained confidence in the fact that I wasn't stuck making 1990's-esque web pages from this one successful project.  Even though I felt that I could somewhat remake the front-ends of websites, Learning the framework itself was not an easy task.

## Turning Pain into Pages
Though frameworks are useful, they can be pretty overwhelming when first learning.  The only way to overcome this is experience and hard work.  Like a wise person once said, "What you put in is what you get out"; nothing could be truer with web frameworks.  Though, at first, all you can think about is the never-ending list of classes and variations, but once you take the time to familiarize yourself with them, front-end development becomes a cinch.  If you ask me, the thought and time you put into learning these frameworks is definitely worth it because it directly translates into skill, understanding, and your success in developing webpages.  In this modern age of web-development, frameworks are truly one of the great ways to flourish.
