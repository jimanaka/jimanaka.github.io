<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<i>The problem:</i> Many UH students need help with studying and homework problems, but they may not be able to go to office hours or may not have many people to ask for help.  There exists tools such as Laulima forums, but these methods are only limited to your class.  Sometimes students want to poll others in their entire major, or other classes.
</p>
<p>
<i>The solution:</i> <b>NAME</b> will be an application that provides an organized forum for professors and students to ask and answer questions.  Users can login and post questions to the relevant major and other users can answer/comment.  The questions will be organized by major/class, but anyone can access all question.  
</p>

<h2>Mockup Page Ideas</h2>
<p>
There are three user roles for this app: site admin, major admin, and student.  Site admins can edit the whole site, major admins can edit only pages within their major, and students can only edit questions they answer.  All users can ask or answer any question.  
</p>
<p>
Each major should have a separate home page to browse recent questions, search for questions, and post new questions.
</p>
<p>
Each user has their own profile page where they can see all their questions and answers.
</p>
<p>Possible Mockup Pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Landing page</li>
<li>Users profile page</li>
<li>Admin home page (by major)</li>
<li>Major home page</li>
<li>Page for each question</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use Case Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>New user goes to landing page, creates account, chooses preferred majors/subjects, and gets a home page/profile</li>
<li>Admin goes to landing page (professor or site admin), log in, and edit their respective major's pages</li>
<li>User goes to landing page, logs in, goes to major of interest, and asks or answers a question</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beyond the Basics</h2>
<p>More detailed features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metadata for each question (topic, class, question status, etc)</li>
<li>Filter questions by Metadata</li>
<li>Implement comments and ratings</li>
<li>Allow question posters and admins to edit individual question pages</li>
<li>Allow for preferred majors and topic per user</li>
</ul>
