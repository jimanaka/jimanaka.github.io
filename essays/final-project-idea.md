<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<i>The problem:</i> Many UH students need help with studying and homework problems, but they may not be able to go to office hours or may not have many people to ask for help.  There exists tools such as Laulima forums, but these methods are only limited to your class.  Sometimes students want to poll others in their entire major, or other classes.
</p>
<p>
<i>The solution:</i> <b>NAME</b> will be an application that provides an organized forum for professors and students to ask and answer questions.  Users can login and post questions to the relevant major and other users can answer/comment.  The questions will be organized by major/class, but anyone can access all question.
