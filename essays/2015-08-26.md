##First Impressions
Prior to this class, I had no knowedge of how to code in JavaScript.  I knew that it was similar to Java in some ways and that it was used to make web pages dynamic but that's about it.  My very first thought when seeing JavaScript code for the first time was: "Where are my variable and function return types!".  See, I'm relatively new to programming in general and all the languages I've learned up until this point were very rigid and straightforward with data types.  In other words, in my world, a variable could only be one thing.  You could say that I was experiencing ICS culture shock.  And it didn't stop there.  Don't even get me started why my professor said "Who every said that an array could only hold one data type?".

##The Learning Process

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
