# Smart Questions for Smart Answers
We live in a world where almost all practical knowledge is at our fingertips.  If the answer you seek is not already online, then there is probably someone out there that can answer it for you.  Because of this, there really is only one question left to ask: How do I extract information I need from others?  The answer to this, of course, is to ask better and smarter questions.  Smart questions are one of the best ways to gather information online from others.  They help communicate your goals clearly while also keeping people who are answering engaged and interested.  

For software engineers, this technique is very important.  Software engineering has developed into an enormous community driven subject where anyone can learn or teach others.  Due to forums and websites like Stack Overflow, experts have never been so accessible.  To receive proper help, it is recommended to ask smart questions for efficiently communication your goals/problems and for the convenience of others.

## A ‘Stupid’ Question
An example of a not-so-smart question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59972779/i-want-my-users-to-login-with-their-user-number-and-password-that-are-inside-my)

This question was asked by a user hoping to fix his implementation for allowing users to access his network with their own username and password.  One thing that could be improved is the description of the problem.  The description reads, “I'm not sure if I am doing it very well, because I have two user on my database with different passwords but only one is able to login. How do I fix it?”.  The poster then pasted his entire code implementation.  He gave no specific details on what he was struggling with and just asked people to fix it for him.  The responses are also representative of how this question was not specific enough.  Instead of getting actual answers to a problem, the replies are things like “don’t use ‘@’ to resolve errors” or to use hashing functions to be more secure.  Nobody could answer this question because nobody knew what specifically to fix.

## A Smarter Approach 
An example of a smart question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59824369/how-to-increase-session-vue-cli-4-0-5-vuex-3-laravel-6-backend-rest-api-app)

This was asked by a user who wanted to extend the log-in time for users on his web API based application.  This question differs from the first by the amount of detail.  The title of the post is “How to increase session vue/cli 4.0.5 / vuex 3 / Laravel 6 Backend REST API app?”.  Just from this title you can see what tool, framework, and API the poster is using.  This can attract others who know about the subject just by looking at the title.  The poster then paste’s his code while explaining the changes he tried and how those worked.  Another good thing he did was update the post whenever he found relevant information.  These factors were reflected by the answer another person provided.  The reply to this question is a set of detailed instructions on how to fix the problem.
