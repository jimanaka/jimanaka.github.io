## First Impressions
Prior to this class, I had no knowledge of how to code in JavaScript.  I knew that it was similar to Java in some ways and that it was used to make web pages dynamic but that's about it.  My very first thought when seeing JavaScript code for the first time was: "Where are my variable and function return types!".  See, I'm relatively new to programming in general and all the languages I've learned up until this point were very rigid and straightforward with data types.  In other words, in my world, a variable could only be one thing.  You could say that I was experiencing ICS culture shock.  And it didn't stop there.  Don't even get me started why my professor said, "Who ever said that an array could only hold one data type?".

## The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

After learning JavaScript for a little under two weeks, I now think that it is an inviting and easy to pick up language.  I think the best part about JavaScript so far is the simplicity.  All you need to write and run JavaScript code is a text editor and a browser.  With just this you can develop an enormous amount of things.  In comparison, a language like Java requires you to configure your machine to have the proper environment that allows for Java compilation and execution.  This means while JavaScript can be worked and executed anywhere at any time, Java cannot.  One downside of JavaScript, to me, is again the lack of variable/return types.  I can see how this is a very valuable function as it allows for more dynamic and varying functionalities, but I think it will just confuse me in the future.  Without proper notation, I can see myself forgetting what type a variable is supposed to be and painfully searching my program for a bug that is almost unnoticeable.  But maybe I just need to get used to it?


## Remembering How it Feels to Be "Athletic"
From my short experience in the ICS program so far, I've always worried about how I would perform in a high-pressure situation where the speed of my programming is just as important as the efficiency.  Every class until ICS 314 has given me all the time I need to solve problems, implement code, and fix bugs.  While I have learned a lot from those experiences it never provided a way to improve the speed of my coding.  WODs provide a perfect way to practice this.  The time requirement is always reasonable and if you still can't finish it, there is a video tutorial on how the professor would solve the problem.  If you must watch the video to figure out the problem, you can just try again and see if you have improved.  It is a great way to practice speed and accuracy without the fear of failing.  WODs also help imprint the importance of reading instructions clearly and carefully.  When I did my first couple WODs, I would finish thinking "wow that was easy!", when I did not do multiple things that the question was actually asking me for.  An example of this was the first WOD.

When I first read the problem, all I saw was "list all natural numbers" and "multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000".  My brain saw those words and thought it knew what to do.  Little did I know that when I finished and read the problem again, I was absolutely wrong.  Fixing this added a whole 3 minutes to my time.  From then on, I read the problem more slowly and carefully.  Overall, I think that WODs are a good balance between stressful, helpful, and fun.
