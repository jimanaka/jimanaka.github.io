## What are Ethics?

In natural environments, every living being encounters problems.  Whether it be finding food, shelter, or a mate, nothing comes free.  To survive, wild animals and early humans had to keep finding new and creative ways to survive and compete.  For each problem that could occur, there is an underlying design model that animals use to solve it.  For the problem of finding food, one design model could be ambush hunting, another could be over-powering, or even man-made agriculture.  One example of the ambush hunting design model could be the technique “stalking”.  Stalking is when one animal follows their prey quietly and unseen until they find an opportunity to quickly incapacitate the target.  Just like there are many ways to ambush hunt, there are also many ways a design model can be implemented to solve a problem. 

## paragraph 2

In life, it is not enough to only use one design model.  Because there is such a variety of problems to solve, we must also implement a variety of design models to achieve our goals.  In terms of the TextBook Hunt website, we also have had to implement multiple design models to build our final product.  One design model we are using is the “Observer Design Model”.  We have implemented this automatically with the help of Meteor Reactivity.  Meteor Reactivity observes when the database has been manipulated, and dynamically changes elements on the doc to reflect those changes.  Another design model we are implementing is, of course, the “Model View Controller Model”.  This model is being implemented in three ways.  For the front-end visual aspect of the site, we are using semantic-ui/react to render pages and html objects.  For the back-end server side, we are using MongoDB to create and manipulate collections of user and book data.  For routing between pages, we are using the basic react router.
