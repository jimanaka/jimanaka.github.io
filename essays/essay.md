# To Framework is to Flourish
## CLose Encounters of the Third Kind
HTML and CSS... oh my.  Until now I've never touched it, barely seen it, and didn't get it.  I've always been curious about how people make webpages.  Was it easy?  There are so many webpages made by so many people, it must be doable.  Was it difficult?  If it's so easy, why is it that the moment I press f12 in a browser my head starts to spin?  No matter the case, there was only one course of action for the past two weeks, to learn.  I'm just going to be blunt, when I first started, I was god awful.  I researched online and watched some online courses but when it came time for me to create a page on my own, I couldn't even remember the first steps.  When it came time to do assignments for class, I had to watch the instructional videos to do anything.  The problem was that it was too alien.  Usually I write code about data and numbers, now, all I could think about was divs and containers.  I was using raw and unadulterated HTML.  Every div or every pixel of padding had to be hand coded.  I was creating such abominations, I started to wonder if I could ever make an aesthetic page.
