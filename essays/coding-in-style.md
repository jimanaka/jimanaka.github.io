# Coding in Style
## The ESLint Dilemma

I’m going to be honest; I hate coding standards and the tools we use to check them.  Whenever there comes a time where I am required to install specific coding standard tools, they always find a way to mess with me.  False errors, tab and spacing issues, or the worst of the worst, false positives.  Whether it be back in ICS 211 or now, I don’t think I’ve ever had a positive experience with tools like ESLint or CheckStyle.  Despite this, I do see the necessity and the advantages of using code standards.  They can reveal small quirks about the language you are using and make your code readable to everyone.  For these reasons, my feeling towards ESLint and coding standards are mixed and it turns out to be quite the dilemma.

## Man vs. Machine
 Installing style tools has always been an uphill battle for me.  Just recently, I was trying to install ESLint and spent over 2 hours trying to get it to work on my desktop.  These tools never have a simple installation process and every IDE comes with a bunch of style tools automatically enabled which can mess with you even more.  To install ESLint I had to download and install a style XML, enable it in 3 different areas of the IDE preferences, install npm, install NodeJS, download a provided eslint file for my project, and disable all other enabled style checkers just so I could start my homework.  There is probably a good reason for this, but I feel like everything could be solved if someone just made an ESLint XML file or IDE installer that can automatically configure ESLint for you.  Maybe it’s just my gross incompetence with installing code style tools, but right now, its me vs my machine.
