# Looking Towards the Future

I remember my first experience being curious about software.  It was almost 15 years ago when I got my first gaming console, the Nintendo Gameboy Advanced.  I had no idea what it was or how it worked, but from the moment I started playing I was hooked.  I would spend hours at a time just sitting down to play.  I was very young so apart from the initial wonder, nothing more ever came out of it.  As I grew older, so did my curiosity.  I started to wonder how it was possible to create these advanced devices that were becoming more and more common place.  Flash forward to my senior year in high school, the time to think about what career path I wanted to take was getting closer and closer.  I remembered all the time that I spent on my computer, on the web, and on my phone, and decided that I would really love to create things that others could use and enjoy.  In the end, I started to get interested in software development/design and cyber security.  Luckily, these are the two topics and studying now!

Overall, I'm relatively new to ICS.  Even though It’s still VERY early in my career I'm still anxious about the future.  Will I have the necessary skills and abilities to get through a stressful interview and get a job?  If I do get a job, will I be able to perform or outperform my peers?  I know it’s early but, it’s things I think about.  Due to this, I want to learn and practice skills that will help me to be confident in my abilities.  Some skills could be, learning to problem solve quickly and efficiently, staying calm in high pressure situations, and of course learning things like different languages/programming techniques.  Though isn’t a very specific list, I believe it’s a good place to start.  To be honest I’m not too sure what practical skills are valued over others.  I guess that’s also something I would like to learn.

A major part of the learning process is experiences.  Being in a situation that really does test your knowledge and abilities is, in my opinion, the best way to learn.  Despite this, I really haven’t been involved with many groups and activities since I started college.  This year will be different though.  For a start, I plan to join Grey Hats to learn more about cyber security and maybe even compete in their competitions.  I also want to join some open-source project or develop something on my own which can be useful to others.  Maybe It will be some program that uses the API’s of the games I play, or maybe a discord bot that my friends use in their channels.  Either would be a challenge for me now, but trying and failing until you get it right is the best way to learn.
